BrowserServer
=============

BrowserServer is the web rendering process for the [isis-browser](/isis-project/isis-browser). The isis-browser uses [BrowserAdapter](/isis-project/BrowserAdapter) to display web pages that are rendered by BrowserServer. This is for performance and security reasons. The webOS process itself does not need to be responsible for rendering unknow/untested content from the web.

_No further development is planned on the component._

For current development news see [isis-project](http://isis-project.org).
